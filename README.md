HNGInternship is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any chat topic. Participants violating these rules will be expelled from the group at the sole discretion of the group administrators.

As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), 
  eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - 
  this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
* We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify an administrator immediately. We can be pinged directly.

If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
* Apologize and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. Admins 
reserve the right to suspend any account if we receive a complaint(s).

**If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let a moderator know. 
Here is a list of the current moderators and their Slack IDs:**

* Mark Essien - @Mark Essien 

Direct, unsolicited contact for hiring or commercial purposes is not acceptable on this Slack. If a user asked you not to directly contact them or reports you for such unsolicited contact then you are expected to stop immediately or risk a ban.

If you have other additions to this rule set (this is a first draft), please submit them as a pull request.

## Google first before asking someone?

Asking someone for help should not be your first course of action. Search for solutions yourself first before asking some. If you don't, expect to be [lmgtfy'ed](http://bfy.tw/QI).

## Do you keep your chat on the same line where appropriate?

Slack chat is not the same as having an SMS conversation with 13 year olds - Keep things together where possible and don't split sentences across lines.
