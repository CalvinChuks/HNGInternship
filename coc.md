HNG Internship Code of Conduct
===========================

Welcome!
--------

The current admins are:
* Mark Essien - @Mark Essien 

HNGInternship is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any chat topic. Participants violating these rules will be expelled from the group at the sole discretion of the group administrators.


Behaviour:
----------------
1. Do not @channel, @everyone in #general.
2. Respect each other and the tools we use.
3. Check the channel list before you decide to make a new channel. If a channel already exists that you want to create, just join it and start chatting!
4. Don't upload copyrighted content, unless it is freely available from the publisher.
5. If you have an issue, contact an admin.

Logs and Records:
-----------------

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Message Retention:
------------------

Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of HNG Internship. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

Harassment:
-----------

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

Reporting
---------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Harrassment:
------------

As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), 
  eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - 
  this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
* We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify an administrator immediately. We can be pinged directly.

If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
* Apologize and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. Admins 
reserve the right to suspend any account if we receive a complaint(s).

Consequences
------------

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
