HNGInternship is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any chat topic. Participants violating these rules will be expelled from the group at the sole discretion of the group administrators.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify an administrator immediately. We can be pinged directly or via the #admin channel.

Direct, unsolicited contact for hiring or commercial purposes is not acceptable on this Slack. If a user asked you not to directly contact them or reports you for such unsolicited contact then you are expected to stop immediately or risk a ban.

If you have other additions to this rule set (this is a first draft), please submit them as a pull request.
